                                        Customer Application: <a href="https://github.com/baonguyenduy2002/FastCoffeeCustomer">https://github.com/baonguyenduy2002/FastCoffeeCustomer</a>

                                <p>Application is developed based on practical demand to technicalize the purchase process at take-away coffee points and connect them to make a convenience for customers on purchasing coffee quickly on their way. 
                                    The system is built with ideas allowing takeaway coffee shops to buy an operating license and register to the system and provide their products to the customer. 
                                    The customer needs to log in to the system and provide their personal information also their preferred drink, coffee shop or frequent route, etc that supports their order. 
                                    The customer can place an order directly on the system and the coffee shop - a partner can accept or refuse it. 
                                    The system will track the customerâ€™s position to notice a partner preparing their drink. 
                                    The system will assist in identifying the right user so that the partner can deliver the correct order to the customer. 
                                    The system also supports the handling of problems between customers and partners. 
                                    The application operates based on the automatic system with tasks to be processed without user interaction. 
                                    The application is built on the foundation of Web applications, Mobile applications using expo, API, and services to provide independent consumer components...</p>
